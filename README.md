# Simulated-annealing

Simulated annealing is an algorithm which aims to find local minimum of the function. It bases on randomness and it is not guaranteed to find the best result, although it is possible to find satisfactionary solution in a limited time.

### Project includes 3 different problems solved with the algorithm. 
1) Traveling Salesman Problem
2) Minimize function of energy for a bitmap
3) Solving sudoku
### Each problem is described further in Jupyter files.

### Possible outcomes of a bitmap problem, as it too large to be kept in .ipnby file.
